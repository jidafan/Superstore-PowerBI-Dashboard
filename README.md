## Introduction

In this project, we will use PowerBI to create a dashboard using superstore sales data. To do so, we will perform a detailed analysis of the sales data and use the forecast tool to generate accurate sales forecasts.

## Data Review

The data is from an Excel file that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jidafan/Superstore-PowerBI-Dashboard/blob/main/Superstore%20Dataset.xlsx). The dataset contains various aspects of financial data, including sales, profits, product performance, and city/state data.
